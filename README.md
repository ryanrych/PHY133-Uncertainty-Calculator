# PHY133-Uncertainty-Calculator
A python 3 program to generate the Google Sheet equations for uncertainty values on the datasheets of PHY 133 at Stony Brook University. 
It has limited ability currently as I only made to write the equations I needed. 


The entire program is put into main.exe for ease of use. After filling out the instructions given in the command line a file path will be given of an Excel
sheet with your equations listed.
